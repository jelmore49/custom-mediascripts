# custom-mediascripts

Custom MediaScript files for Portfolio Server 9 through 11 from Extensis.

These were proof-of-concept scripts that were never deployed in the wild, as far as I know.

These were also an experiment in [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), so the comments are extra wordy.
